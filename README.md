# Microstructural Fingerprinting Tools
Python package for constructing compressed representations of microstructural image data.


## Examples

Examples provided operate on a 3-class subset of the Carnegie Mellon University ultrahigh carbon steel (CMU-UHCS)
dataset, which can be downloaded  [here](https://materialsdata.nist.gov/handle/11256/940).

Two main approaches for feature extraction are considered. Namely, visual bag of words (VBOW) and convolutional neural
networks (CNN). There are two options for CNN fingerprints (flattening or max-pooling of final convolution layer into
single vector). `cnn_fingerprints.py` provides an example with either AlexNet or VGG for feature extraction and
flattening or max-pooling for fingerprint construction.

VBOW operates on base features. These can either come from keypoint-based methods, such as the scale-invariant feature
transform (SIFT), or from CNN features output from the final convolution layer. `vbow_fingerprints.py` provides an
example with either SIFT, SURF or CNN base features. Number of clusters and order of fingerprints can also be specified.
